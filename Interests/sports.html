        <p><strong>Favourite sport:</strong> Power lifting </p>
        <p>
           My faverite sport in which I compete in is power lifting. I currently compete with the Ucc Powerlifting Club. 
           This sport involves constant improving and dicipline and training to increase the amount you can 
           Squat, Bench and Deadlift heavy weight.Competitions are singular events that involves
           competeing against other lifters to see who can lift the most in there respective weight class.
           Although it is a reletivly new sport in ireland, it is constantly growing with now
           an ever growing young community.

            Max out to see how much i need to increase my weight by in order to progressivly overload
            which is the main method to get stronger.</p>
