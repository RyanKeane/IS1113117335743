        <p>I have many interest which vary into into many varying areas. I have a large interest in sport 
           which varys between sports such as galic hurling and football, to the more "head on" sports such as
           mma , karate and ju jitzu. Most of which i have competed at some level in. Other non-sport
           related interests i have are music, reading and anime. In terms of music I play a variety of 
           instrument mainly traditional Irish instruments such as the flute and the tin whistle 
           and i have also competed in multaple fleath ceols unfortunetly to no avail.
           In terms of reading and anime they kindof go hand in hand as i read a lot of whats called 
           "manga" which is japanese comic books. The animation adeptation of these comics are called
           anime. My faverite manga would be "Tokyo Ghoul" , "Full Metal Alchamest" and "Black Clover".
           My all time faverite anime is "Errased".
