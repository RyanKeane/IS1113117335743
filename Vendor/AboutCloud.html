    <p align="center"><b>Software as a Service (SaaS) </b>
              <br /> 
               Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications
               and makes them available to customers over the Internet. 
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Advantages </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
              <br />
                1.Reduced time to benefit
              <br />
                Different from the traditional model, in SaaS the software (application) is already installed and configured. The user has the advantage of provisioning the server for an instance in cloudand in a couple hours they can have the application ready for use. This reduces the time spent in installation and configuration, and can reduce the issues that  can get in the way of  the software deployment.
              <br />
                2. Lower costs
              <br />
                SaaS has a differential regarding costs since it usually resides in a shared or multitenant environment where the hardware and software license costs are low compared with the traditional model.
                Another advantage is that the customer base can be increased since it allows small and medium  businesses (SMB) to use a software that otherwise they would not use due to the high cost of license.
                Maintenance costs are reduced as well, since the SaaS provider owns the environment and it is split among all customers that use that solution.
              <br />
                3. New releases (upgrades)
              <br />
                SaaS providers upgrade the solution and it becomes available for their customers. Costs and effort associated with upgrades and new releases are lower than the traditional model that usually forces the user to buy an upgrade package and install it, or pay for specialized services to get the environment upgraded.
              <br />

     <p align="center"><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS)  </b>
              <br /> 
              Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and
              software tools usually those needed for application development to users over the internet.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Advantages </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
              <br />
                1.Storage
              <br />
               With a PaaS, companies don't have excess resources in reserve.
               The development tools are provided by the PaaS, and not all of the iterations of the code need to be stored in the data center.
              <br />
                2. Lower skill requirements
              <br />
                By providing the development tools and middleware, a PaaS lowers the skill level required to deploy applications and removes the bottleneck
                that can form while waiting for one specific person's assistance.
              <br />
                3. No large upfront cost
              <br />
               Enhance ability to react to changes and opportunities because the organization doesnâ€™t
               have large up-front costs associated with typical application development and deployment
              <br />

     <p align="center"><b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) </b>
              <br /> 
             Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the next step down from Platform as a Service (PaaS) and two steps down from Software as a Service (SaaS)
             in the Cloud Computing Stack. Instead of ready-made applications or services, developement tools, databases, etc., IaaS provides the underlying operating systems, security,
             networking, and servers for developing such applications, services, and for deploying development tools and databases.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Advantages </strong>

               <p>
              <br />
                1.No mantanence given 
              <br />
               You or your organization are responsible for the versioning/upgrades of software developed (this is also a disadvantage).
              <br />
                2.New releases handled by the cloud provider.
              <br />
               No need to manage the introduction of new releases of the development or underlying software. This is handled by the IaaS Cloud Provider.
              <br />
                3. Releases handled by the cloud provider.
              <br />
                SaaS providers upgrade the solution and it becomes available for their customers. Costs and effort associated with upgrades and new releases are lower than the traditional model that usually 
                forces the user to buy an upgrade package and install it, or pay for specialized services to get the environment upgraded.

      <p align="center"><b>	Communication as a Service (CaaS) </b>
              <br /> 
              Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor.
              Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM),
              collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. 
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Advantages </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
              <br />
                1.Flexibility and Expandability
              <br />
               CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, 
               allowing for the addition of devices, 
               modes or coverage on demand. 
              <br />
                2. Widely used in industry today
              <br />
               sent video, voice, and data across the public Internet to correspond with others free of charge or at a low cost
              <br />
                3. Prices continueing to drop 
              <br />
               As this service has become more widely available and mainstream, prices are continuing to drop for this service 
               which will only make it more widely used in the marketplace.
