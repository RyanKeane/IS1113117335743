                   Salesforce is the world's #1 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform.
                   Our cloud-based applications for sales, service, marketing, and more don't require IT experts to set up or manage
                   â€” simply log in and start connecting to customers in a whole new way.

                   AWS Cloud9 gives you the flexibility to run your development environment on a managed Amazon EC2 instance or any existing Linux server that supports SSH.
                   This means that you can write, run, and debug applications with just a browser and without the need to install or maintain a local IDE.
                   The Cloud9 code editor and integrated debugger include helpful, time-saving features such as code hinting, code completion, and step-through debugging. 
                   The Cloud9 terminal provides a browser-based shell experience allowing you to install additional software, do a git push, or enter commands.

                   Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features,
                   computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. 
                   Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.

                   Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. 
                   Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices.
                   CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS).
